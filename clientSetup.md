# WireGuard Client Setup

## Linux Client

### 1. Install WireGuard
```bash
sudo apt install wireguard
```

### 2. Generate Client Keys
```bash
wg genkey | tee private.key | wg pubkey > public.key
cat public.key  # Send this to server admin
```

### 3. Create Config File
```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```
```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = [CONTENT OF private.key]
Address = 10.0.0.X/24  # X = 2,3,4 etc (unique for each client)

[Peer]
PublicKey = [SERVER'S PUBLIC KEY]
Endpoint = [SERVER_PUBLIC_IP]:51820
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### 4. Start Connection
```bash
sudo wg-quick up wg0
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0  # Optional: auto-start on boot
```

### 5. Test Connection
```bash
ping 10.0.0.1
sudo wg show
```

## Mac/Windows Client (GUI)

### 1. Install WireGuard App
- Mac: Download from App Store or https://www.wireguard.com/install/
- Windows: Download from https://www.wireguard.com/install/

### 2. Create New Tunnel
- Click **Add Tunnel** → **Create from scratch** or **Empty tunnel**
- App generates keys automatically

### 3. Configure Tunnel
```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = [GENERATED BY APP]
Address = 10.0.0.X/24  # X = 2,3,4 etc (unique for each client)
DNS = 8.8.8.8  # Optional

[Peer]
PublicKey = [SERVER'S PUBLIC KEY]
Endpoint = [SERVER_PUBLIC_IP]:51820
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### 4. Activate
- Click **Activate** button
- Check status shows "Active"

### 5. Get Client Public Key
- Copy public key from interface section
- Send to server admin to add as peer

## Important Notes
- Each client needs unique IP address (10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, etc.)
- Client public key must be added to server config
- PersistentKeepalive keeps NAT connections open
- AllowedIPs determines what traffic goes through VPN
